## LeetCode SQL Exercises

This repository contains my daily coding practice, primarily focused on SQL problems from platforms like LeetCode and StrataScratch.

It serves as a learning log to practice and strengthen core SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs, while documenting my problem-solving approach over time.

Each query represents a problem I’ve successfully solved and kept here for consistency, review, and interview preparation.

Queries in this repository are ordered by difficulty in descending order.
