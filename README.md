## StrataScratch SQL Exercises

This repository contains my successfully completed SQL solutions from StrataScratch.  
It serves as a learning log to practice and strengthen core SQL concepts, including joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.

Each query represents a problem I’ve successfully solved. This repository is used for ongoing learning while building strong problem-solving patterns for technical interviews.
